# What happened?

### The space shuttle Challenger was ready to launch on the morning of Tuesday, January 28, 1986.

![Figure 1. Prepared to launch](/Users/davidwheeler/Desktop/TEACHING/Statistical literacy/StatisticalLiteracyRepo/LessonsFromTheChallenger/Launch.png)

---

### This was a symbolic flight. 

![Figure 2. The crew](/Users/davidwheeler/Desktop/TEACHING/Statistical literacy/StatisticalLiteracyRepo/LessonsFromTheChallenger/crew.png)

---

### The night before the launch there was a three hour teleconference between Morton Thoikol, Marshall Space Flight Center, and Kennedy Space Center. The subject of the discussion was the sensitivity of O-rings, which seal the joints in booster rockets, to lower temperatures. 

![Figure 3. O-rings seal joints on booster rockets](/Users/davidwheeler/Desktop/TEACHING/Statistical literacy/StatisticalLiteracyRepo/LessonsFromTheChallenger/Oring.png)

---

### The discussion considered the data below. 
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=F}
library(ggplot2) # for plotting
library(plotly)
library(GGally) # for scatterplot matrices
library(gridExtra) # for arranging multiple plots together
library(car) # For Likelihood Ratio Tests on the fly
library(data.table) # to enable creation and coercion of data tables
library(stargazer) # to tabulate regression tables
library(skimr) # for basic EDA
library(knitr)
library(dplyr) # for coercing dataframes and summary statistic
```

```{r echo=F, results="hide"}
# Import data
df = read.table("challenger.csv", header=T, sep=",")
# Present data
# kable(df)
```

```{r, echo=F, fig.cap="Figure 4. O-ring failure as a function of temperature"}  



# O-ring vs Temperature
ggplot(df[df$O.ring > 0,], aes(x=Temp, y=as.factor(O.ring))) +
  geom_jitter(size = 4, alpha = 0.75, height=.05, width=.3) +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Temperature (°F)")+
  scale_y_discrete(name = "Number of\nO-ring failures") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 12)) +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.5, 1.05), legend.title=element_text(size=9), legend.text=element_text(size=7)) +  
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0)) + 
  theme(
  axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12),
  axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12),
  axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12),
  axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
  plot.title = element_text(size = 12)) 
```

- Upon inspection of *this* plot, most of the participants concluded that, since the plot is "U"  shaped, there was **no** evidence that temperature affected O-ring failure.

- **Lesson**: the absence of evidence $\neq$ evidence of absence.

- In contrast, at least one participant, Roger Boisjoly, stated that "temperature was indeed a discriminator".

---

### Regardless, the Challenger was launched the following morning.

![Figure 5. Challenger launch (NASA)](/Users/davidwheeler/Desktop/TEACHING/Statistical literacy/StatisticalLiteracyRepo/LessonsFromTheChallenger/Takeoff.png)

---

### 73 seconds into the flight, the shuttle exploded. 

![Figure 6. The O-rings failed](/Users/davidwheeler/Desktop/TEACHING/Statistical literacy/StatisticalLiteracyRepo/LessonsFromTheChallenger/MM.png)
---

- Following the accident, President Regan appointed William Rogers to lead a committee to investigate the incident.

- The committee concluded that "A combustion gas leak through the right Solid Rocket Motor aft field joint initiated at or shortly after ignition eventually weakened and/or penetrated the External Tank initiating vehicle structural breakup and loss of the Space Shuttle *Challenger*."

- Further, the committee concluded that "careful analysis of the flight history of the O-ring performance would have revealed the correlation of O-ring damage in low temperature".


---

# What *should* have happened?

---

### To understand the message from the committee, let's look at the data:
```{r echo=F}
# Present data
kable(df)
```

- The number of O-rings that failed during 23 total flights was recorded with the temperature and pressure of the joints at launch.

---

### Notice that some observations, those where 0 O-ring failures occured, were omitted.

```{r, echo=F, fig.cap="Figure 7. O-ring failure as a function of temperature"}  


# O-ring vs Temperature
ggplot(df, aes(x=Temp, y=as.factor(O.ring), colour=O.ring>0)) +
  geom_jitter(size = 4, alpha = 0.75, height=.05, width=.3) +
  scale_color_manual(labels = c("ommitted","considered"),
                                values = rev(c("black","grey"))) +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Temperature (°F)")+
  scale_y_discrete(name = "Number of\nO-ring failures") +
  #geom_rug(alpha=2/4, size=1, position="jitter") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 12)) +
  labs(title=expression(color="Observations:"))+
  theme(legend.position = c(0.5, 1.05), legend.title=element_text(size=9), legend.text=element_text(size=7)) +  
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0)) + 
  theme(
  axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12),
  axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12),
  axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12),
  axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
  plot.title = element_text(size = 12)) 
```

- **Lessons**: 
  - ommission of outliers can be dangerous
  - outlier detection can be conditional on the inclusion/omission of other observations

### O-ring failure might also be sensitive to pressure.

```{r echo=F,message=F,warning=F, fig.cap="Figure 8. Number of O-ring failures as a function of temperature and pressure"}
fig <- plot_ly(df, x = ~ Temp, y = ~ Pressure, z = ~ factor(O.ring),
               color = ~ factor(O.ring),
               colors = c('olivedrab', 'orange2',"orangered2"))
fig <- fig %>% add_markers()
fig <- fig %>% layout(title=" ",
  scene = list(xaxis = list(title = 'Temperature (°F)'),
                     yaxis = list(title = 'Pressure'),
                     zaxis = list(title = 'Number of O-ring failures')))
fig
```

- **Lesson**: sometimes it's valuable to consider several explanatory variables that may contribute to the response.

---

### With the full dataset, another relationship(s) is apparent. To test the influence of temperature and pressure on O-ring failure, we have a couple options.

- One option is to model the number of O-ring failures as a function of temperature and pressure.
  - **Are there any problems with this approach**?

- Another option is to model O-ring failure as a binary function of temperature and pressure.
  - **Are there any problems with this approach**?
  
---

```{r,echo=F, warning=F,results='asis'}
# Create new variable Fail for binary model
df["Failure"] <- ifelse(df$O.ring>=1, 1, 0)

# Estimate a binomial logistic regression model
model_binomial <- glm(O.ring/Number ~ Temp + Pressure,
               family = binomial(link = logit),
               weights = Number, data = df)
# Estimate binary logistic regression model
model_binary <- glm(Failure ~ Temp + Pressure,
               family = binomial(link = logit),
               data = df)
# Summary of coefficients, standard errors and p-values
stargazer(model_binomial, model_binary, 
         type = "html",
         model.numbers = FALSE,
         dep.var.labels  = c("binomial","binary"),
         column.labels = c("No.of O-ring failures", "O-ring failure"))
```

---

Consider the binomial model below:

$$ logit\left(\hat{\pi}\right)= 2.520 - 0.098\text{ temperature} + 0.008\text{ pressure} $$
- And the inverse odds ratio:

```{r echo=F}
# Inverse odds ratio for binomial model
1/exp(summary(model_binomial)$coefficients)
```

- For the binomial logistic regression model with `temperature` and `pressure` included, we see that a unit decrease in temperature changes the odds of failure by 1.1 times.

---

Now consider the binary model below:

$$ logit\left(\hat{\pi}\right)= 13.292 - 0.229\text{ temperature} + 0.010\text{ pressure} $$
- And the inverse odds ratio:

```{r echo=F}
# Inverse odds ratio for binary model
1/exp(summary(model_binary)$coefficients)
```

- For the binary logistic regression model with `temperature` and `pressure` included, we see that a unit decrease in temperature changes the odds of failure by 1.25 times.

- **Lesson**: temperature matters!

---

### Does pressure actually matter?

- To determine if both explanatory variables matter, we test $H_0: \beta = 0$ vs $H_A:\beta \neq 0$, for both `temperature` and `pressure`, for the binary model:

```{r echo=F}
Anova(model_binary, test='LR')
```

- **Lesson**: temperature matters!
- Should we really remove `pressure` from the model? What are the advantages and disadvantages?

---

### Temperature matters but... how confident are we that cooler temperatures really increase the odds of O-ring failure?

```{r echo=F, fig.cap="Figure 9. O-ring failure as a function of temperature"}  

# Estimate binary logistic regression model
model_binary2 <- glm(Failure ~ Temp,
               family = binomial(link = logit),
               data = df)
# Create an array for temperature between 31 and 81 degrees
t <- seq(31,81,1)
alpha=0.05
model_predict <- predict(object=model_binary2 , newdata=data.frame(Temp=t), type='link', se=T)
CI_lower_linear <- model_predict$fit + qnorm(p=alpha/2)*model_predict$se.fit
CI_lower_pi <- exp(CI_lower_linear)/(1+exp(CI_lower_linear))
CI_higher_linear <- model_predict$fit + qnorm(p=1-alpha/2)*model_predict$se.fit
CI_higher_pi <- exp(CI_higher_linear)/(1+exp(CI_higher_linear))

##### pi with CI vs temp
plot(df$Temp, df$Failure,
     xlab= "Temperature (°F)",
     ylab=expression(pi),
     pch=20, cex=1.5,
     xlim=c(31,81),
     ylim=c(0,1))
# Betas
b0 <- model_binary2$coefficients[1]
b1 <- model_binary2$coefficients[2]
curve(expr = exp(b0+b1*x)/(1+exp(b0+b1*x)), add=T)
lines(t, CI_lower_pi, lty = 'dashed')
lines(t, CI_higher_pi, lty = 'dashed')
```

- Why is the confidence band wider at lower temperatures than at higher temperatures?

---

### How confident are we that O-rings would fail at a cold temperature, say 36°F, and a warm temperature, say 72°F? 

```{r warning=FALSE, echo=F, results="hide"}  


# Set a seed
set.seed(1)

# Use pi estimated from the model
z = model_binary2$coefficients["(Intercept)"] + model_binary2$coefficients["Temp"] * df$Temp
pi = exp(z)/(1+exp(z))

# Save the pi array to the dataframe
df$O.ring.pi <- pi

# Dataframe to populate with results
results <- data.frame(pred.36 = numeric(), pred.72 = numeric())

# For s in 1000 bootstrap resamples
for (s in 1:1000){
  
  I.sample <- sample(x = 1:nrow(df),
                     size = 23,
                     replace = T)
  # Populate d with samples
  d <- df[I.sample,]  
  # Simulate outcomes using rbinom
  O.ring2 <- rbinom(n=23, # sample size
                size=6, # number of trials
                prob=d$O.ring.pi) # probability
  d <- data.frame(d, O.ring2)
  # Estimate model with rbinom bootstrap outcomes
  mod <- glm(Failure ~ Temp,
               family = binomial(link = logit),
               data = d)
  # Estimate confidence interval for temp = 36
  temp.36.data <- data.frame(Temp=26)
  temp.36 <- predict(object = mod, newdata = temp.36.data,
                      type = "response")
  # Estimate confidence interval for temp = 72
  temp.72.data <- data.frame(Temp=72)
  temp.72 <- predict(object = mod, newdata = temp.72.data,
                      type = "response")
  results <- results %>% add_row(pred.36 = temp.36, pred.72 = temp.72)  
}

CI.36 <- quantile(results[,1], probs=c(0.05, 0.95))
CI.72 <- quantile(results[,2], probs=c(0.05, 0.95))
data.frame(temp=c(36,72), lower.CI=c(CI.36[1],CI.72[1]), upper.CI=c(CI.36[2],CI.72[2]))

```

```{r, fig.height=8, fig.width=8, echo=F, fig.cap="Figure 10. 90% confidence interval estimated with a parametric bootstrap approach"}


# Plot histograms of confidence intervals
par(mfrow=c(2,1),mar=c(5,4,4,2))
# Histogram for temp = 31
hist(results[,1],
     breaks=50,
     col="skyblue",
     xlab=expression(pi),
     xlim=c(0,1),
     main=' ')
mtext('(a) Probability of failure at 36 °F', side = 3, padj = -2.5)
# Histogram for temp = 72
hist(results[,2],
     breaks=10,
     col="orangered",
     xlab=expression(pi),
     xlim=c(0,1), main=' ')
mtext('(b) Probability of failure at 72 °F', side = 3, padj = -2.5)
```

- Why are is the confidence interval for 36°F wider than for 72°F?

- **Lesson**
  - more data generally reduces the variability of our estimates.

# Lessons
- the absence of evidence $\neq$ evidence of absence.
- ommission of outliers can be dangerous.
- outlier detection can be conditional on the inclusion/omission of other observations.
- sometimes it's valuable to consider several explanatory variables that may contribute to the response.

# What did we miss?
- Evaluation of assumptions and model diagnostics.
- Model validation!
