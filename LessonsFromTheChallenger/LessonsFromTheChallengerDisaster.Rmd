# What happened?

### The space shuttle Challenger was ready to launch on the morning of Tuesday, January 28, 1986.

### This was a symbiolic flight.

### The night before the launch there was a 3 hour teleconference between Morton Thoikol, Marshall Space Flight Center, and Kennedy Space Center. The subject of the discussion was the sensitivity of O-rings, which seal the joints in booster rockets, to low temperatures.

### The discussion considered the data below. 
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=F}
library(ggplot2) # for plotting
library(plotly)
library(GGally) # for scatterplot matrices
library(gridExtra) # for arranging multiple plots together
library(car) # For Likelihood Ratio Tests on the fly
library(data.table) # to enable creation and coercion of data tables
library(stargazer) # to tabulate regression tables
library(skimr) # for basic EDA
library(knitr)
library(dplyr) # for coercing dataframes and summary statistic
```

```{r echo=F}
# Import data
df = read.table("challenger.csv", header=T, sep=",")
# Present data
# kable(df)
```


### Upon inspection of *this* plot, most of the participants concluded that, since the plot is "U"  shaped, there was **no** evidence that temperature affected O-ring failure.
```{r, echo=F, fig.cap="O-ring failure as a function of temperature"}
# O-ring vs Temperature
ggplot(df[df$O.ring > 0,], aes(x=Temp, y=as.factor(O.ring))) +
  geom_jitter(size = 1, alpha = 0.75, stroke=3, height=.05, width=.3) +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Temperature (°F)")+
  scale_y_discrete(name = "Number of\nO-ring failures") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 12)) +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.5, 1.05), legend.title=element_text(size=9), legend.text=element_text(size=7)) +  
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0)) + 
  theme(
  axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12),
  axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12),
  axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12),
  axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
  plot.title = element_text(size = 12)) 
```

### In contrast, at least one participant, Roger Boisjoly, stated that "temperature was indeed a discriminator".

### Regardless, the Challenger was launched the following morning.

### 73 seconds into the flight, the shuttle exploded.

# What *should* have happened?

### Following the accident, President Regan appointed William Rogers to lead a committee to investigate the incident.

### The committee concluded that "A combustion gas leak through the right Solid Rocket Motor aft field joint initiated at or shortly after ignition eventually weakened and/or penetrated the External Tank initiating vehicle structural breakup and loss of the Space Shuttle *Challenger*."

### Further, the committee concluded that "careful analysis of the flight history of the O-ring performance would have revealed the correlation of O-ring damage in low temperature".

### To understand the message from the committee, let's look at the data:
```{r echo=F}
# Present data
kable(df)
```

#### The number of O-rings that failed during 23 total flights was recorded witht the temperature and pressure of the joints at launch.

### O-ring failure as a function of temperature

```{r, echo=F, fig.cap="O-ring failure as a function of temperature"}
# O-ring vs Temperature
ggplot(df, aes(x=Temp, y=as.factor(O.ring), colour=O.ring>0)) +
  geom_jitter(size = 1, alpha = 0.75, stroke=3, height=.05, width=.3) +
  scale_color_manual(labels = c("ommitted","considered"),
                                values = rev(c("black","grey"))) +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Temperature (°F)")+
  scale_y_discrete(name = "Number of\nO-ring failures") +
  #geom_rug(alpha=2/4, size=1, position="jitter") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 12)) +
  labs(title=expression(color="Observations:"))+
  theme(legend.position = c(0.5, 1.05), legend.title=element_text(size=9), legend.text=element_text(size=7)) +  
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0)) + 
  theme(
  axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12),
  axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12),
  axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12),
  axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
  plot.title = element_text(size = 12))
